# RaylibIntendedLibrary
This is a library that is an extension of the RayLib game development library.

> Because Raylib is great, but boilerplate isn't.

So far, this library only has a button definition, but I plan on adding much more, as long as there is demand for this.
## The overarching goal of this library
Speed up the—admittedly already quite fast—GUI development in RayLib.
The goal is to have the simplicity of RayLib with some pre-made patterns.
## A non-comprehensive to-do list
- [ ] All button types:
  - [ ] Textureless button
  - [ ] A colored button
  - [ ] Button with a 2DTexture
- [ ] 3D Render handling
  - [ ] A 3D world struct(containing the player(camera), objects(planes, cubes, ...), ...)
